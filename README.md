# coding-101-java
This project contains a set of unit tests to guide the hands-on learning journey for the coding-101 participants. The idea is that the participants don't need to know the details of the unit tests located inside `src/main/testing`. For each test class a class with boilerplate method bodies exists inside `src/main/learnjava`. Based on these pre-defined classes and the test output printed to the console for the existing test suites their task will be to fix the failing tests by filling the empty methods with the expected logic. 




## How to use
This repository is meant to be imported to https://repl.it/ in order to remove the overhead of setting up IDEs on the participants computers. The file `.replit` contains the commands that will be executed by repl.it when the participant presses the "Run" Button in the UI.
